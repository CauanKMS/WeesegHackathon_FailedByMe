# WeesegHackathon - I Failed

Well, I failed at it. At least I tried, of course. I know u were gonna say that kinda shit like "at least u tried, man".
But u know, I gotta accomplish something once in a while. I've gotta watch my mouth a lil more before I say "I know JavaScript".
Or at least for Node.js.
It's not that difficult, but I just didn't know what to do.

I've gotta study harder this thing. That's what I gotta do.

But, by now, stay with my failed attempt at this amazing hackathon. Maybe I'll be a good front-end dev after that. Maybe not.
